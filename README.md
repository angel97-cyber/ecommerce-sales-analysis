# E-Commerce Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive analysis of a sample sales dataset for an online electronics store. The goal was to explore the data, identify key trends, and provide actionable, data-driven recommendations to help the business increase its revenue and improve its marketing strategy. The entire analysis was conducted in a Jupyter Notebook using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## Key Business Questions Answered

1.  What was the best month for sales?
2.  Which city had the highest number of sales?
3.  What time of day is best for advertising?
4.  What products are most often sold together?
5.  Which product sold the most?

## Summary of Findings & Recommendations

-   **Peak Sales Month is November:** Sales spike dramatically in November, likely due to holiday shopping. **Recommendation:** Increase inventory and marketing spend in late October and November.
-   **Madrid is the Top Market:** Madrid generates significantly more revenue than any other city. **Recommendation:** Focus advertising efforts on the Madrid area and consider localized marketing campaigns.
-   **Product Bundling Opportunities:** A market basket analysis revealed that certain products are frequently purchased together. **Recommendation:** Create "bundle and save" promotions and a "Frequently Bought Together" feature on the website.
-   **Top-Selling Product:** The "1992 Ferrari 360 Spider red" (`S18_3232`) is the store's hero product. **Recommendation:** Ensure this item is always in stock and feature it prominently in marketing materials.
-   **Data Quality Issue Identified:** It was discovered that the dataset lacks specific time-of-day information for orders, preventing an analysis of peak shopping hours. **Recommendation:** Update the sales system to capture full timestamps for future analysis.

## Technologies Used

-   **Python**
-   **Pandas:** For data loading, cleaning, manipulation, and aggregation.
-   **Matplotlib:** For data visualization.
-   **Jupyter Notebook:** For creating the interactive, end-to-end analysis report.
